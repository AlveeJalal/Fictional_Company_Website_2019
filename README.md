# Fictional_Company_Website_2019

A website for a fictional company. This was completed by me and a group of 4 other people as a way to demonstrate what we learned in our Computer Science class in our sophomore year of high-school. We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

I only worked on a portion of the website. I did the products page and the individual pages for each product, while my other team members did the other web pages.  

This was a rushed group project. **We weren't very experienced in web development so this project has some bugs. I did what I could as I was still a beginner in web development
